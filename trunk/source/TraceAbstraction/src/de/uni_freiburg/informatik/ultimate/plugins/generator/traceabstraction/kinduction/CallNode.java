/**
 * A state of the abstraction together with the chain of call sites it was reached through: the node type of the flat
 * graph {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} works on once calls are resolved.
 * <p>
 * The flat graph has no call stack, so a callee that is called from two sites and is not summarized but
 * <em>unfolded</em> must contribute two disjoint copies of its states - otherwise the two call sites look like a
 * loop and a path may enter at one of them and return to the other, splicing away everything in between (see the
 * {@link ProcedureSummaries} class javadoc). The call site chain is what makes those copies distinct: two nodes are
 * equal only if they carry the same state and were reached through the same sequence of call sites.
 * <p>
 * The chain is stored as a link to the <b>call site node</b> in the caller, which is itself a {@code CallNode} and
 * therefore carries the rest of the chain. A node of the procedure the analysis starts in has no such frame. Because
 * recursion is rejected before any unfolding starts (see {@link ProcedureCallGraph#getProceduresCalleeFirst()}), the
 * chain is always finite.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * CallNode<STATE> callSite = ...;                  // a state of the caller with an outgoing call transition
 * CallNode<STATE> entry = callSite.enter(e);       // the callee's entry state, one level deeper
 * CallNode<STATE> exit = entry.sibling(x);         // another state of the callee, same frame
 * CallNode<STATE> afterReturn = callSite.sibling(r); // back in the caller, at the return's successor
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Instances are immutable and their hash code is computed once, in the constructor: they are used as map keys
 * throughout the loop tree and the pc transition system.
 *
