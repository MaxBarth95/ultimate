/**
 * The abstraction seen through {@link CallNode}s: every node keeps the chain of call sites it was reached through,
 * and an internal transition keeps that chain, because it stays inside one procedure activation.
 * <p>
 * Calls and returns are <b>not</b> transitions of this graph. {@link ProcedureSummaries} resolves each of them
 * beforehand, either into a summary edge over the whole call-to-return span (a callee without loops) or into a pair
 * of virtual edges around an unfolded copy of the callee (a callee with loops). Both are virtual edges of
 * {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder}, so reporting no call and no return transition here is not a way of ignoring them
 * - it states that none is left.
 *
 * @param <LETTER>
 *            letter type
 * @param <STATE>
 *            state type of the abstraction
