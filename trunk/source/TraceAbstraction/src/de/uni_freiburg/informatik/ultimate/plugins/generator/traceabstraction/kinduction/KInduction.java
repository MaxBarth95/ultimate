/**
 * k-induction on a nested word automaton (path program or abstraction) that represents a program with any number of
 * loops, sequential or nested.
 * <p>
 * {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} summarizes the program as a tree of loops whose edges are transition formulas between
 * checkpoints (program start, loop heads, error states, ...). {@link PcTransitionSystem} turns this into one transition
 * system whose state is the program variables plus a program counter {@code pc}. An error is reachable iff the system
 * reaches {@code pc = FINAL}. This class runs plain k-induction on it, for {@code k = 1, 2, ...}:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Base case</b>: {@code pc_0 = INIT}, k transitions, {@code pc_k = FINAL}. SAT means (<i>unsafe</i>), since
 * FINAL has a self loop this covers every error within k steps.
 * <li><b>Step case</b>: k transitions starting in an arbitrary state that is not {@code INIT}, no error in the first k
 * states, but an error in the last one. UNSAT together with the base case for k proves that no error is reachable at
 * all (<i>safe</i>). INIT can be excluded in the first state because it has no incoming transition, so every error at a
 * step {@code > k} is preceded by k non-INIT states, and errors at steps {@code <= k} are found by the base case.
 * </ul>
 * Since the whole program, including all loop heads, is one system, a SAFE result is a genuine proof also for several
 * and for nested loops; there is no per-loop or per-path approximation. The only incompleteness is {@link #MAX_K} and
 * the solver returning unknown.
 * <p>
 * <b>Procedures.</b> The transition system is flat and has no call stack, so it never contains a call or a return. If
 * the abstraction has any, {@link ProcedureSummaries} resolves every call site first: a callee whose graph is loop-free
 * becomes one edge for the whole call-to-return span (and one edge per error state inside it, for a call that never
 * returns), while a callee that contains a loop is unfolded into one copy of its states per call site, so that its loop
 * becomes an ordinary nested loop of the tree and gets {@code pc} values of its own. The nodes of the tree are
 * therefore {@link CallNode}s - a state plus the call sites it was reached through - and a loop head of an unfolded
 * callee is a different head at each of its call sites. Recursion is refused there.
 * <p>
 * <b>Invariant injection.</b> The {@link IInvariantSupplier} may return a trusted invariant for any loop head, also a
 * nested one. It is assumed in every unrolled state where {@code pc} is that loop head, in the base and the step case.
 * This only prunes the search and can make a loop inductive that is not k-inductive on its own, but a wrong invariant
 * makes the result wrong. An invariant that mentions a variable that occurs in no transition is dropped, which is
 * always sound. With probation, the supplier watches how long the queries take and may interrupt one that an
 * invariant made slow, after publishing a better invariant. k-induction then takes the answer of the supplier's
 * probe, or asks the query again for a violation (see {@link #answer}).
 * <p>
 * <b>Learned invariants.</b> If the program is proven safe with some k, {@link #getLearnedInvariants()} returns for
 * every loop head the formula "no error can be reached from here within k steps". It holds in every reachable state of
 * the head, because the program is safe, and can be given to other components as an invariant.
