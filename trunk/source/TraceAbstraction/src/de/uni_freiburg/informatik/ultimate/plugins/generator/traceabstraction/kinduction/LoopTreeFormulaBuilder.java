/**
 * Given a nested word automaton, builds every {@link UnmodifiableTransFormula} that k-induction (and IMC) needs, for
 * programs with no loop, any number of sequential loops, and arbitrarily <b>nested</b> loops.
 * <p>
 * The result is a {@link LoopTree}: a tree of {@link Scope}s. The root scope is the whole program, every other scope
 * is one loop. Inside a scope, the nodes are <em>checkpoints</em> (see {@link Checkpoint}): the scope's start
 * ({@code INIT}, one per head of the scope), the heads of its directly nested loops, its end ({@code END(h)}, one of
 * the scope's own heads reached again after one iteration), the error/accepting states ({@code FINAL}) and every
 * state the scope can leave to ({@code ESCAPE}, e.g. a {@code break} out of a loop). The edges are formulas
 * summarizing <b>all</b> loop-free paths between two checkpoints, so the requested parts are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>part before / after a loop: the root scope's edges {@code INIT -> loopHead} and {@code loopHead -> FINAL} (for
 * a nested loop: the same edges in its enclosing loop's scope),
 * <li>loop entry: {@link Scope#getEntry}, the union of the transitions that go from a head into the loop,
 * <li>loop exit: {@link Scope#getExit}, the union of the transitions that leave the loop from a head,
 * <li>loop body: {@link Scope#getBody()} for a loop with one head and without inner loops (one iteration, head back
 * to head, including the entry transition). Any other loop has no single loop-free body formula; its body is the
 * checkpoint graph of its scope ({@link Scope#getEdge}), where each head of each inner loop is a checkpoint,
 * <li>no loop at all: the root scope's edge {@code INIT -> FINAL} is the whole program.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Loops are found structurally (strongly connected components, recursively with the heads removed), so no annotation
 * is required. Several entry and exit transitions per head are supported.
 *
 * <h2>Loops with several heads</h2>
 *
 * The heads of a loop are <b>all</b> the states it is entered at from outside it. A reducible loop has one;
 * irreducible control flow (a {@code goto} into the middle of a loop, or an abstraction in which one loop head
 * location has split into several states) has more, and is supported rather than rejected. Every head gets its own
 * {@code INIT(h)} and {@code END(h)} checkpoint, so a scope with the heads {@code h1, h2} has the edges
 * {@code INIT(h1) -> END(h1)}, {@code INIT(h1) -> END(h2)}, {@code INIT(h2) -> END(h1)} and
 * {@code INIT(h2) -> END(h2)}: the traversals of one iteration, by where it started and where it came back round to.
 * <p>
 * The cross edges are not an extra. An iteration from {@code h1} to {@code h2} has no other representation, because
 * in the enclosing scope both heads are sealed (they are nodes with no outgoing edges) and everything between them
 * is an interior state that is not a node there at all. Taking every entry state as a head is also what keeps the
 * recursion correct, see invariant (I1) at {@code findHeads}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Procedure calls</h2>
 *
 * Call and return transitions are <b>not</b> edges of this graph. A call's transition formula is only the
 * parameter assignment and a return's only the assignment of the result, so using them as ordinary edges gets the
 * scoping of oldvars, modifiable globals and the callee's locals wrong, and - because the graph has no stack - it
 * also admits paths that leave through one call site and come back at another, splicing away everything in
 * between. Both of those are silent unsoundness, so a call or a return that would end up as an edge here is
 * <b>refused</b> (see {@code rejectUnresolvedCallsAndReturns}).
 * <p>
 * Instead, a caller resolves every call site into a "virtual" call edge before building: one formula for a whole
 * call-to-return span, passed to the scoped constructor. {@link ProcedureSummaries} builds those for k-induction
 * and {@code InterproceduralImcOrchestrator} for IMC, both with
 * {@link ProcedureCallGraph#computeVirtualEdge}. A call or a return whose target lies outside the scope is then
 * simply not an edge of this scope's graph, which is the point: the callee is described by the virtual edge.
 * <p>
 * A callee that contains a loop has no such formula. For it, {@link ProcedureSummaries} instead <em>unfolds</em> a
 * copy of the callee per call site into the graph, with a virtual edge for the call and one for the return, and
 * hands this builder an {@link ICallResolvedGraph} whose nodes are {@link CallNode}s rather than plain states. The
 * copies are distinct nodes, so the splicing above cannot happen, and the callee's loop is found by the ordinary
 * SCC search as a nested loop of the caller's scope. Nothing below cares which of the two resolutions produced a
 * node: this class only ever sees a graph with no call and no return transition left.
 *
 * <h2>How to use</h2>
 *
 * Construct the builder, call {@link #build()} once, and read the formulas off the scopes of the resulting
 * {@link LoopTree}. All formulas live in the {@link ManagedScript} passed to the constructor. That script must
 * <b>not</b> be locked while {@link #build()} runs: composing transition formulas declares constants for their aux
 * vars and therefore acquires the lock itself. Lock the script afterwards, once all formulas exist, to use them in a
 * solver. Every {@code getEdge} returns {@code null} if there is no such path, which is normal and not an error.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final LoopTreeFormulaBuilder<LETTER, STATE> builder =
 * 		new LoopTreeFormulaBuilder<>(services, logger, mgdScript, nwa);
 * final LoopTree<STATE> tree = builder.build();
 * final Scope<STATE> root = tree.getRoot();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <b>No loop.</b> The whole program is one formula:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final UnmodifiableTransFormula program = root.getEdge(Checkpoint.init(), Checkpoint.fin());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <b>Sequential loops.</b> The parts before and after each loop are edges of the root scope, the loop itself is a
 * child scope. The part between two loops {@code a} and {@code b} is
 * {@code root.getEdge(Checkpoint.loopHead(a), Checkpoint.loopHead(b))}, and {@code root.enumeratePaths()} lists all
 * checkpoint sequences from the program start to an error state, e.g. {@code [INIT, loopHead(a), loopHead(b), FINAL]}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * for (final STATE head : root.getLoopHeads()) {
 * 	final Scope<STATE> loop = root.getChild(head);
 * 	final Checkpoint<STATE> headCp = Checkpoint.loopHead(head);
 * 	final UnmodifiableTransFormula before = root.getEdge(Checkpoint.init(), headCp);
 * 	final UnmodifiableTransFormula after = root.getEdge(headCp, Checkpoint.fin());
 * 	final UnmodifiableTransFormula entry = loop.getEntry(head); // head into the loop
 * 	final UnmodifiableTransFormula exit = loop.getExit(head); // head out of the loop
 * 	final UnmodifiableTransFormula body = loop.getBody(); // one iteration; single-head loops only
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The edges leaving {@code Checkpoint.init(head)} inside a loop scope include the entry transition, so
 * {@code getBody()} already contains the loop condition; {@code getEntry(head)} gives the entry transition on its
 * own.
 * <p>
 * <b>Nested loops.</b> {@code tree.getLoops()} lists all loops, outer loops before the loops nested in them. A loop
 * with one head and without inner loops (see {@link Scope#isLeaf()}) has a single body formula. For any other loop
 * {@code getBody()} throws an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}; use the checkpoint graph of its scope instead,
 * in which every head of every inner loop is a checkpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * for (final Scope<STATE> loop : tree.getLoops()) {
 * 	if (loop.isLeaf() && loop.getHeads().size() == 1) {
 * 		final UnmodifiableTransFormula body = loop.getBody();
 * 	} else {
 * 		final STATE head = loop.getHeads().iterator().next();
 * 		final Checkpoint<STATE> inner = Checkpoint.loopHead(loop.getLoopHeads().iterator().next());
 * 		loop.getEdge(Checkpoint.init(head), inner); // start of this loop's body to the inner loop head
 * 		loop.getEdge(inner, Checkpoint.end(head)); // inner loop head back to this loop's head
 * 		loop.getEdge(inner, Checkpoint.fin()); // inner loop head to an error state
 * 		loop.getEdge(inner, Checkpoint.escape(state)); // inner loop head to a state outside this loop (break)
 * 	}
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * To restrict the builder to a single procedure, use the second constructor with explicit scope, initial and final
 * states.
