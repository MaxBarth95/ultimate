/**
 * The transition relation {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} reads its flat graph from. It is the part of
 * {@link INestedWordAutomaton} that the builder actually uses, so that the builder's nodes do not have to be the
 * automaton's states.
 * <p>
 * Two implementations exist. {@link AutomatonGraph} is the automaton itself, for a caller that hands the builder a
 * scope of plain states. {@link UnfoldedGraph} has {@link CallNode}s as nodes, so that a callee which is unfolded
 * rather than summarized contributes one copy of its states per call site; the call and the return themselves are
 * not transitions there but virtual edges built by {@link ProcedureSummaries}.
 * <p>
 * The call and return accessors exist only so that {@code LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} can <b>refuse</b> a call or
 * return that would silently become an ordinary edge of a stackless graph. An implementation whose calls are all
 * resolved already reports none.

 * @param <LETTER>
