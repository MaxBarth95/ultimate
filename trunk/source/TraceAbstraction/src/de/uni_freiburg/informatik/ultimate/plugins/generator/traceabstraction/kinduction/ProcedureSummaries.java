/**
 * Resolves every procedure call of a nested word automaton, so that the graph {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} builds -
 * and therefore the {@link PcTransitionSystem} built from it - contains no call and no return transition.
 * <p>
 * Why this is needed rather than convenient: a flat graph has no call stack. Putting a call and a return into it
 * as ordinary edges makes a callee that is called from two sites look like a <em>loop</em> (site1 -&gt; entry,
 * exit -&gt; after-site1, ... -&gt; site2 -&gt; entry) and admits paths that enter at one call site and return to
 * another, splicing away everything in between. On top of that, a call's transition formula is only the parameter
 * assignment and a return's only the assignment of the result, so the scoping of oldvars, modifiable globals and
 * the callee's locals would be wrong as well.
 *
 * <h2>Summarizing or unfolding</h2>
 *
 * There are two ways to resolve a call site, and which one applies is decided per procedure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <b>summarizable</b> procedure - its own graph is loop-free and every procedure it calls is summarizable -
 * becomes a single <b>summary edge</b> per call transition and per exit state of the callee,
 * {@code callSite -> post-return state}, with the callee's entry-to-exit formula composed with the call and the
 * return by {@link ProcedureCallGraph#computeVirtualEdge}. No state of the callee enters the caller's graph.
 * <li>Any other procedure - one that contains a loop, or that calls such a procedure - has no single loop-free
 * entry-to-exit formula, so it is <b>unfolded</b> instead: its states are copied into the caller's graph, one copy
 * per call site (that is what a {@link CallNode}'s call site chain distinguishes), with a virtual edge into the
 * copy for the call and one out of it for the return. Its loops then are ordinary nested loops of the caller's
 * loop tree, which {@code LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} and {@code PcTransitionSystem} already support at any depth.
 * </ul>
 * Summarizing is kept for the procedures it fits because it is much cheaper: one formula instead of a copy of the
 * callee's whole graph, and no extra {@code pc} value per loop head per call site.
 *
 * <h2>Errors inside a callee</h2>
 *
 * An error state of a <b>summarized</b> callee becomes an <b>error edge</b> {@code callSite -> that error state},
 * built with {@link TransFormulaUtils#sequentialCompositionWithPendingCall}. The error state becomes a state (and a
 * final state) of the caller's graph, sealed so that its own transitions are not edges there, see
 * {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder}'s sealed-state constructor. Error states are carried up this way through any
 * number of levels. In an <b>unfolded</b> callee the error state is simply a node of the copy, and needs no edge of
 * its own. Either way the call stays pending, so such a node is reported by {@link #getPendingErrorTargets()} and
 * {@link KInductionCounterexampleBuilder} knows the counterexample ends with an unmatched call.
 * <p>
 * Every summary formula is built for <b>one</b> call transition and <b>one</b> exit resp. error state, never for
 * the union of all of them: the union would let a path that reaches one exit leave through another exit's return
 * transition, which the abstraction does not admit, and k-induction would answer UNSAFE on a path that no
 * counterexample can realise.
 *
 * <h2>What is not supported</h2>
 *
 * A procedure that reads an {@code old(g)} and calls a procedure that is unfolded or stack-encoded and may
 * overwrite that snapshot, see {@code rejectOldVarReadsAcrossStackFreeCalls}: neither an unfolded nor a stacked
 * activation gets its own copy of the oldvars, because {@link PcTransitionSystem} does not keep oldvars in the
 * state at all.
 * <p>
 * Recursion and an unfolding too big to build are <b>not</b> in this list any more. A procedure on a call cycle,
 * and any procedure whose unfolding would not fit into {@link #MAX_UNFOLDED_NODES}, is given an activation record
 * instead - see {@link CallStack} - so its states occur exactly once in the graph and its recursive call is an
 * ordinary loop of it.
