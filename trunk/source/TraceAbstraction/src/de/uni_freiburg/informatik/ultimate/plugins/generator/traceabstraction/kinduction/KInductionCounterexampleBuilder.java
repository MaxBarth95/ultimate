/**
 * Turns a {@link KInductionWitness} - what the solver's model of a satisfiable base case said - into a concrete
 * {@link NestedRun} of the abstraction that reaches an accepting state.
 *
 * <h2>Why a search is needed at all</h2>
 *
 * A step of the {@link PcTransitionSystem} is not a single letter. Each of its transitions is one edge of one
 * scope's checkpoint graph, and {@link LoopTreeFormulaBuilder} built that edge by composing whole <em>paths</em> of
 * letters: {@code sequentialComposition} for concatenation, {@code parallelComposition} for the union of
 * alternatives, and, at a call site, a whole call-to-return span ({@link ProcedureSummaries}). The union is built
 * without branch indicators, so the composed formula does not record which alternative a model took, and the
 * letters themselves are gone. The model therefore pins down the program state at every checkpoint, but not the
 * way between two of them; that has to be searched for.
 *
 * <h2>What the search may and may not assume</h2>
 *
 * The model is used for the <b>shape</b> of the violation only: which pc node each unrolled state has, and which
 * transition was taken between two of them. That fixes, for every step, the automaton states the letter path has to
 * run between, which is what makes the search tractable.
 * <p>
 * The model's <b>variable values</b> are deliberately not used. A composed edge relation need not agree with any
 * single concrete path about the value a variable ends up with - where the composition leaves an out-variable
 * unconstrained, the model may pick a value no concrete path produces - so constraining the search with those
 * values makes it fail on perfectly good counterexamples. Feasibility is therefore established by the search
 * itself, which is what actually matters.
 * <p>
 * Every path the search considers is checked against the solver as it is extended, over one continuous SSA that
 * spans all steps, so the run that comes back is feasible as a whole and ends in an accepting state. It is
 * therefore a genuine counterexample no matter what the pc encoding did, and
 * {@code KInductionWorkerThread.reportCounterexample} independently confirms it with the ordinary trace check. If
 * the encoding were ever to over-approximate and report a violation that does not exist, no feasible path would be
 * found and this class would throw rather than invent one.
 *
 * <h2>Calls</h2>
 *
 * A pc transition can be a whole call-to-return span, so the search walks call and return transitions as well, with
 * a stack of the call sites it has entered; a return is only ever taken with the hierarchical predecessor that
 * stack names, which is what makes the reconstructed word properly nested. The SSA mirrors what
 * {@code TransFormulaUtils.sequentialCompositionWithCallAndReturn} did to the formula the model was produced from:
 * at a call the parameter assignment is asserted, every oldvar of a global the callee may modify is set to that
 * global's current value, and every local of the callee that is not an inparam becomes an unconstrained fresh
 * constant (it is arbitrary at procedure entry); at the return the assignment of the result is asserted and the
 * callee's scope - those oldvars and locals - is restored to what the caller saw. An oldvar that no call on the
 * stack assigns keeps {@code getDefaultConstant()}, exactly as {@code PcTransitionSystem.instantiate} uses it.
 * <p>
 * A step ends where the pc transition's target nodes are. Each such node carries the call sites it stands for, so
 * a step over a <em>summarized</em> call ends back in the caller with an empty stack, while a step inside an
 * <em>unfolded</em> callee ends with exactly that callee's call sites still open - its loop heads are pc values of
 * their own, so ending there is normal. A violation inside a summarized callee is the one node that says less than
 * the stack does: {@link ProcedureSummaries} resolves it into an edge into the callee's error state, which names
 * only the direct call site although the error may lie several summarized levels deeper, so the run ends there with
 * those calls still pending and the nested word gets unmatched call positions.
 *
 * <h2>How far the search may wander</h2>
 *
 * Per step the letter path is <b>simple, except that its last state may equal its first</b>. A cut graph is
 * acyclic, and all of a scope's own heads and the heads of its inner loops are sealed in it - they are nodes but
 * have no outgoing edges - so such a state can only ever be a path's last. The exception is what a loop body needs:
 * {@code INIT(h) -> END(h)} in a loop scope runs from the head back to the head. Restricting the search to simple
 * paths alone would drop exactly those, and restricting it no further keeps the search finite. A state visited
 * inside a call is a different search node from the same state visited outside it, since the two differ in what
 * the run may do next, so "simple" is meant with respect to the call stack.
 * <p>
 * A loop that is entered at several heads also has the steps {@code INIT(h1) -> END(h2)}, whose path runs between
 * two <em>different</em> sealed states and is therefore plainly simple. On such a program the search may leave the
 * transition the model named and come back through a third head, so the run it returns need not be the model's.
 * That is harmless: the path was checked against the solver as it was extended, {@link #assemble} re-checks it with
 * {@code Accepts}, and {@code KInductionWorkerThread.reportCounterexample} re-runs the ordinary trace check - so
 * what comes back is a genuine counterexample either way.
