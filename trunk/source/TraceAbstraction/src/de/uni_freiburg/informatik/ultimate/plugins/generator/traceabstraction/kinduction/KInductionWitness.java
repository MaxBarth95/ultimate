/**
 * What the solver's model of a satisfiable k-induction base case says about the <em>shape</em> of the violation: the
 * program counter of every unrolled state and the transition taken between consecutive ones.
 * <p>
 * This is plain data, read off the model in {@code KInduction.checkBase} <b>before</b> the {@code pop} that discards
 * it, and afterwards the only thing {@link KInductionCounterexampleBuilder} needs from the solver.
 * <p>
 * Deliberately <b>almost no variable values</b>. A pc transition is a whole composed path, and the composition does
 * not have to agree with any single concrete path about the value a variable ends up with - an edge whose composed
 * relation leaves a variable unconstrained lets the model pick a value the concrete path would never produce. Using
 * such values to constrain the reconstruction makes it fail on perfectly good counterexamples. The pc and the
 * transition ids are safe to rely on, because they are what the encoding is about, and the reconstruction checks
 * feasibility for itself anyway.
 * <p>
 * {@link CallStack}'s stack pointer is the one exception, and for a reason that does not generalise: no composition
 * ever leaves it unconstrained. Every alternative of every edge either does not mention it - and is then framed to
 * keep it - or moves it by exactly one per call or return on that alternative. So the model does not pick its value,
 * the path does, and a reconstruction that follows the model's value is following the alternative the model chose.
 * That is what tells {@link KInductionCounterexampleBuilder} how many activations are open at a step boundary, which
 * a node of a stack-encoded procedure cannot say by itself.
